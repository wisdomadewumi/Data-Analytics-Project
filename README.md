# Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Analytics Project** repository! ☄️

This project shows SQL scripts I used for data Exploration, Analysis and Reporting. It is based on the outcome of a **[Data Warehouse Project](https://github.com/wisdomadewumi/Data-Warehouse-Project)** I built sometime ago; I use the gold layer for this pahse. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices and orderly workflow in data and analytics.

2. **Analytics**: Analyzing customer demographics, product categories, and other dimensions for segmentation. Also, calculating key business metrics like total sales, average price, and total customers.
3. **Reporting**: Generating summary reports of key metrics for business insights.

## 🧩 Skills Showcased

1. **Database Exploration:** Querying metadata using INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES and INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to understand database structure.
2. **Data Retrieval:** Using SELECT statements with filtering, grouping, and ordering to extract meaningful data.
3. **Joins:** Performing LEFT JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables (e.g., fact_sales, dim_customers, and dim_products).
4. **Aggregations:** Using aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX to calculate metrics.
5. **Window Functions:** Applying RANK and ROW_NUMBER for ranking and partitioning data.
6. **Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Using subqueries and WITH clauses for complex queries and intermediate calculations.
7. **Conditional Filtering:** Using WHERE and HAVING clauses to filter data based on specific conditions.
8. **Union Operations:** Combining results from multiple queries using UNION ALL.
9. **Sorting and Limiting Results:** Using ORDER BY and TOP to sort and limit query results.
